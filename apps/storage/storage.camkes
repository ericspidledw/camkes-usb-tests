/*
Scenarios to consider:
- priority:
	- client priority == server priority - succeed
	- client priority < server priority  - succeed
	- client priority > server priority  - succeed
- scheduling context
	- client has enough SC: succeed 
	- client doesn't have enough SC: succeed (roll over to the next period)
	- server has enough SC: succeed
	- server doesn't have enough SC: succeed (roll over to the next period)
- if client/server doesn't have enough SC
	- budget << period: succeed - longer delay
	- budget < period: succeed - shorter delay
	- budget = period: succeed - no delay

should we time how long the calls take? or does it matter (thinking behind this: tell the difference between a call succeeding in one period or having to wait for it to reset and continuing when it goes over budget and also how long the period is)
